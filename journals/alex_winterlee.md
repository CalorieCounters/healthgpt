These Journals were kept in the Notes app of my Macbook, so if the dates are not entirely accurate I apologize that they weren't commited along the way for the accurate dates.

May 15th:
As a group, we had a conversation weighing the pros and cons of each database choice, ulitmately deciding on using Postgres

May 17th:
We started planning out how the app was going to look, picking and choosing what data we wanted to track and how the modles were going to look.

May 18th:
We started messing around with our 3rd party API, looking at the data we would be getting back and what we could do with it.

May 22nd:
Sorry for not writing the last few days. Life gets crazy out here. Life in a codeWars (get it?) is nevery pretty. Danger left and right. JWTDown threw some good punches, but we finally got it beat.

May 24th:
We were still fighting with some bugs in the Authentication, getting help from seirs and instructors. Progress is being made.

May 26th:
Pushed up the completed Signup, Login, and create account. After that we merged them to main. Finally we have fully functioning authentication for our app.

May 30th:
Spent a lot of time today trying to make the create a meal. It keeps giving us issues and as of right now we aren't sure what it is.

June 1st:
Continued working on the ability to log a meal. More and more I am learning how much Django spoiled us...

June 5th:
Split into groups to start working on the front end forms for each aspect of the site. This is the part where I feel the most comfortable.

June 6th:
Still more working on the front end. It feels like we're getting closer to the end each day, but at the same time it feels so far away lol. React just makes more sense to me than FastAPI, but that's more than likely because we have more experience with it.

June 7th;
I realized how much I had been slacking on these journals the whole time, so this week I am trying to be better. We keep getting closer every day, and I personally keep learning new things about React and JSX that make everything easier and also cooler.

June 8th:
Most of our stuff is done now. I have been spending most of today and yesterday in a seperate room doing final touches on the CSS and front end functionality while the other group works on finishing up the Dashboard aspect.
